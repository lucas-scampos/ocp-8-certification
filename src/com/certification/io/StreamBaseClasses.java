*  Writer

*  For convenience, the authors of java API include the name of the abstract parent class as the suffix of the child class
*  ex: ObjectInputStream ends with InputStream, meaning it has InputStream and a inherited parent class

*  PrintStream doesnt follow this rule, which it is a OutputStream
