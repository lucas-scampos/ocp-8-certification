1. C, E - OK
2. E - OK
3. A, D, C - X (A,D)
4. A, D, F - X (A,D)
- F is incorrect, as it has no right-side expression - () ->

5. B, E, F, D - X (B,E,F)
-D is incorrect, as the object must be marked private.
If it was marked protected, it would not be properly encapsulated and other classes would have access to it

6. A - OK
7. C, E, G, H (OK)
8. C, F, (OK)
9. F - X (D,F)
- The public modifier on the cheetahManager instance means that any class can access or even replace the instance, which breaks the singleton pattern;
 hence D is required to fix the implementation
10. D (OK)
11. A, F (OK)
12. C (OK)
13. B, C, E (OK)
14. A, B, D, E (OK)
TurtleFrog is a Frog

16. F (OK)
17. B, F - X (B,C,F)
- All variables are marked as private

18. A, B, E (OK)
19. A, E (B,D,E)
- A is incorrect, as that is a property of the immutable object pattern
- D is correct, as we only want one class writing to a log file at once
20. A - OK
